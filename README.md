# Modern UI/UX Website

This project was a tutorial by [JavaScriptMastery](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_modern_ui_ux_gpt3).

## Skills Learned

- Replicate design from [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/lz9lLpFHMxHm2odnwM3R0z/gpt3?node-id=0-1)
- React Functional components and their reusability
- React file and folder structure
- Fundamental CSS properties to master flex & grid
- Fundamentals of the CSS BEM Model
- Implementation of basic animation using [Animista](https://animista.net/)
- Utilization of complex gradients generated via [AngryTools](https://angrytools.com/)
- Perfectly placed media queries for satisfactory responsiveness covering almost devices

## Why should this matter?

I followed this tutorial, but not as a crutch, as a learning tool. The exposure to React given in this tutorial I believe will be more than sufficient in giving me the ability to recollect these skills for future employment needs.
